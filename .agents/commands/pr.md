description: Create a pull request from current branch to develop (repo-scoped)
---

## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Commits ahead of develop: !`git log develop..HEAD --oneline`
- Diff vs develop: !`git diff develop..HEAD --stat`
- Uncommitted changes: !`git status --short`

## Task

Create a Pull Request from the current branch into `develop`.

**Rules (non-negotiable):**
- PR title and body MUST be in **English** — always, no exceptions
- Command scope MUST stay inside the current repository
- Never target `main` directly — PRs always go to `develop`
- If there are uncommitted changes, STOP and warn the user before proceeding
- Branch name MUST match: `^(feat|fix|chore|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|revert)\/[a-z0-9._-]+$`

**Steps:**
1. Verify branch name matches the required pattern
2. Run tests before creating the PR: `go test ./...` — if they fail, STOP and warn the user. Skip tests if changes are documentation-only.
3. Push branch to remote: `git push -u origin HEAD`
4. Draft the PR title and body using the template below. **Show the full draft to the user and STOP — wait for explicit confirmation before creating the PR.**
5. Once confirmed, create the PR with `gh pr create --base develop`
6. Show the PR URL and STOP — wait for user confirmation before proceeding to merge

### Safe command construction (zsh-safe)

When creating the PR body, always use a HEREDOC and command substitution exactly like this pattern:

```bash
gh pr create --base develop --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<markdown body>
EOF
)"
```

Never inline raw markdown directly in a quoted one-liner.
Never execute chained PR-create + merge in a single command.
Create PR first, then stop and wait for explicit user confirmation before merge.

---

**PR title format:** `<type>(<scope>): <short imperative description>` — max 70 chars

Examples:
- `fix(automations): audit and fix 9 bugs in engine and calendar contract`
- `feat(gym_tracker): add automation contract with 5 triggers and 4 actions`

---

**PR body template** (follows `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`):

```markdown
